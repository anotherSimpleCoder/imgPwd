# imgPwd
*A password generator using images*

### About
imgPwd is a password generator I wrote for myself to have (i guess) a unique and fun way to generate passwords by using images.
The entire program is written in C and is also using the libpng library (really nice library).

### How to use imgPwd
Give the program a path to a PNG image, a keyword and a path to store you password as a txt file.

### Build
The binary at the moment is just available for Linux (well works in Arch idk bout other distros).
If you want to use imgPwd in a different OS feel free to build this project:

* Clone this repository
* Open your terminal
* Change directory to the repository's directory
* Enter ```make compile``` to compile and build imgPwd.
* Voil√° you've build imgPwd!
